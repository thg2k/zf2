S3:

- Removed Abstract::setEndpoint(), there is no reason to expose the endpoint of a webservice. This is
   builtin in the definitions, like the parameters name etc. it only clutters the interface


 - Dropped multiple support of putFile() and putFileStream() because at this level is
   pointless: if you have a stored file on the harddisk, you always want to stream it,
   and if for any esoteric reason you really don't want to, doing a putObject(file_get_contents($file)) is not going
   to kill anybody and won't clutter your higher level code.

 - Dropped cleanBucket() method
   Rationale: A developer firstly approaching these APIs shouldn't need to know/understand the internal working
     of the underlying REST APIs, so all we want him to know that each of his method calls will be resolved with O(1)
     HTTP calls to the underlying APIs. So this method 
     Also reimplementing this functionality in the caller is not a big deal, it can be implemented with a simple foreach()
     and a multipleDelete() call


 - Method getBuckets() renamed to Service::listBuckets()
   Rationale: listing buckets is something invisible to the Bucket object, so it has been moved to the Service class,
     which is able to manipulate buckets, and uses the work "list" rather then the abused "get".


 - Deleting a bucket
     I'm in doubt between removeBucket, destroyBucket, and deleteBucket




// test suite:



 create bucket1
 create bucket2
 test listBuckets
 put object in bucket1
 try to remove non empty bucket1
 remove object
 remove bucket1
 remove bucket2
 try to remove non existing bucket1
